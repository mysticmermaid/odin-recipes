    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Protein Bars</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of vegan protein powder</li>
            <li>1/3 cup and 1 tbsp of date syrup</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of almond butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of melted cocoa butter</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of candied pecans</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Glaze</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp of cocoa butter, melted</li>
            <li>5 tbsp of powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>Place the candied pecans in the bowl of a food processor, pulse a few times until roughly chopped. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the protein powder, brown rice syrup, maple syrup, and almond butter to the bowl of a food processor. Process for a few seconds until roughly combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the melted cocoa butter, cinnamon and vanilla extract, and process for another 10-15 seconds, or until coarse meal forms. Test the dough by taking about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and press it firmly in your hands, if it sticks together it’s okay. If it’s still too crumbly, add 1-2 tsp brown rice syrup and mix for another 3-5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in the chopped pecans. Mix with your hands until the pecans pieces are well distributed.</li>
            <li>Line a 7×5 inch baking dish with parchment paper. Transfer the mixture to the dish and flatten, pressing down firmly with your hands, or the bottom of a glass. You can also flatten the dough between two sheets of parchment paper until you get the desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>For the glaze: Melt the cocoa butter over low heat in a small saucepan. Transfer to a bowl and add the powdered sugar (or maple syrup) and vanilla extract. Mix well with a spoon until smooth and well combined. If you want a thicker glaze, add more powdered sugar. For a thinner glaze, add more cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the bars with the glaze and chill in the fridge for about 1 hour. Remove from the fridge and cut into 4-5 bars.</li>
            <li>The bars will keep for up to 3 weeks at room temperature, wrapped in plastic film. You don’t have to keep the bars in the fridge, the glaze won’t melt at room temperature.</li>
       
        </ol>
