    <h2>Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies</h2>
        <p>Do you ever feel inspired by those well-adjusted families on TV that somehow manage to whip up a delicious looking baked good at the drop of a hat? Well, how do we get to that level of magic in our breakfast game? The answer is so simple in fact that it may astound you to know this Sunday morning dream can be accomplished with only three ingredients! Sometimes the simple pleasure are really just that: Simple. Lack of ingredients doesn't mean lack of taste in these gooey ooey morning treats.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rolled or Old fashioned oats</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Chocolate Chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add all ingredients and mix very well, until fully combined. If using chocolate chips, stir them in with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Lightly wet your hands and form 8 balls with the cookies. Place each ball on the lined mat, and press each ball into a cookie shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until slightly golden on the edges. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <li>Allow cooling on the mat for 10 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        
    </ol>
